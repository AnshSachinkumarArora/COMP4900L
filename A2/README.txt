I constructed an orrery as required in the spec, it has 3 different planets, each with their own independently moving
moons. The sizes of the planets as well as the speed of all the celestial bodies are different and randomized per run. 

I faced a challenge trying to implement the lighting and shaders correctly.

There are no extra steps required to build my project.
